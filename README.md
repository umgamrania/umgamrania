## A little about me

I'm a computer student, from Rajkot, Gujarat. I've been with computers, since 2018. The thing I like most about computers is that they do EXACTLY what I tell them to. I code for fun, and look forward to helping everyone, and engineering something that helps the mass.

<br>

## Stuff I like
 * C/C++
 * Python
 * Java
 * Full stack Web Dev.
 * Android
